	I have changed a lot of things in order to make installation *hopefully*
	easier.  There is now an scvim executable that looks for scvimrc to load in this order:
	~/.scvimrc, /usr/local/share/scvim/scvimrc, /usr/share/scvim/scvimrc
	the cache dir defaults to ~/.scvim/
	there is no need for the SCVIM_DIR environment variable anymore

	Dan Stowell moved the SCVim supercollider code into a class, now SCVim docs
	and cache data can be updated inside SuperCollider.  Dan has also moved
	some things around: he created the 'cache/' directory which contains all of
	the data that is modified by scvim, everything else can be read only.
