the help generation should fail if you don't have unrtf, but it doesn't seem to

for some reason there are some things that if you send via visual block they
work, but if you send via the send block function F5, it doesn't.

if you try to send things like this by using the send block function F5
foo (
			things i want to send
		) bar

you'll send foo and bar too, that function currently sends the whole line
