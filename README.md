# Mac's dot files

Hi! Here are my dot files. They are always a work in progress and aren't really packaged for anyone else, so you will
have to do some work to get them working for you, I'm sure, but hopefully you find them useful.

I more or less rely on these tools:

## OS independent

- FiraCode https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode
- FiraMono https://github.com/mozilla/Fira
- fzf
- oh-my-zsh
- diff-so-fancy
- https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid
- ag (ag-silversearcher in apt), ripgrep, tmux
- htop
- btop
- exuberant-ctags
- kitty
- tmux

## Linux

- Ubuntu
- i3wm
- i3statusbar
- picom (build from source https://github.com/yshui/picom)
